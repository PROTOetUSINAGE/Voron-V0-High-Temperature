# Voron_V0_High_Temperature

The idea  was to make a Voron V0 with the capability of printing high temperature materials like PEI, PEEK ...
A lot of rework was made to be able to fit everything.

I don't even know if we can still call it a Voron V0.
By accident, I maybe design the Smallest High Temp 3D Printer.

## Ceracteristics :

- Print volume : 115x115x115mm( a little bits maller than a V0 )
- Max speed : 500mm/s at 20000mm/s² acceleration
- Max printing speed : around 250mm/s
- Duet3D mini 5+ control board
- Bondtech Mini LGX extruder
- 24V PSU
- Watercooled Hotend Dragon Highflow up to 450°C
- 60W cartridge Heater for the hotend
- Compatible with V6 nozzle ( so I can use brass, copper, steel, ... nozzle )
- Force convection heated chamber up to 230°C 
- 400W 230V cartridge heater with fins for the chamber
- Ø100mm aluminium blower power by a bldc motor 
- Glass fiber reinforce PEI bed
- 100W 230V Silicone heater pad for the bed
- 250°C thermal fuse to protect my house from fire
- Tig welded steel chamber 1mm thick sheet
- CNC milled frame and gantry
- Tig welded aluminium hood with polycarbonate windows and leds
- Custom clamp mechanism for the bed 
- Custom bellow made from PI ( Kapton and PTFE tape)
- Door with borosilicate double glazing 
- Milled Dibond panel
- 7 fans if you count the blower
- The few parts who are 3d printed are made of PEKK-CF
- The printer weighs 10kg ( which is a lot for it size )
- Almost same fooprint as the V0 230x300mm

Around 800hr was needed to make the first example.
